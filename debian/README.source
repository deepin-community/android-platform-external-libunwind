Files under debian/include
==========================

These files are extracted from the AOSP forked external project LZMA [1] which
is actually the "p7zip" package in Debian. However the package does not provide
separated binary packages for lib7z.so or its header files, therefore we include
the file in this package.

See the filed bug [2].
